  Looking to the future and a need for farmland that would provide a ideal
  climate for mink; natural resources to support a feed program; a labor force
  with professional standards; and room for growth; Jan looked to Poland. It war
  here in 1991 that the first expansion of Unicorn Fur Farms took place. In
  years to come, John and Twan took over the helm and increased the van Ansem
  family holdings to onclude mink farms in the USA, Latvia and Romania.
